Ingredients:
- half bag of black beans (or use canned)
- one onion
- three cloves of garlic
- a few tablespoons of corn starch
- cumin to taste
- chili powder to taste
- one egg
- salt to taste

Directions:
1. Prepare the black beans. They're terrific in the instant pot: wash the beans, add them to the pot with plenty of extra water at the top, salt the water very well, and turn it on High Pressure for 25 minutes. I definitely prefer this to canned.
2. Dice the onion and garlic.
3. When the beans are done, add them to a mixing bowl with everything else except the corn starch. Leave the egg out until you've tasted the levels of chili, cumin, and salt.
4. Mash with a potato masher or something else that mashes (a fork is fine). Add some corn starch as you're mashing until the texture is gloopy but not too solid. Getting the texture right is important.
5. Heat a thin layer of oil in a skillet. Heat should be somewhat high.
6. Form the burgers into patties and add to the skillet. Once they're a little blackened on on one side, flip to the other. Adjust heat so they cook in the middle while also blackening a little on the outside.

Serving Suggestions:
- Potato buns are great! They're nice and fluffy, which goes well with the soft texture of these burgers.
- Sri racha mayo.
- Other than that, everything you like on a burger.
- Very freezable.
